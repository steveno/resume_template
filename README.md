# Steven Oliver's Resume Template

## About
This is a template repository I setup to share how I build my resume. Feel
free to use this template for you own resume! For a discussion on how this
works, check out my [blog post](https://steveno.github.io/2024/08/17/how-i-build-my-resume.html).

## Building
I use [TexStudio](https://www.texstudio.org/) for all of my LaTeX work. If you clone
this repository, open the resume or cover letter and then press "play" in TexStudio,
it should generate a PDF for you without any issue.
